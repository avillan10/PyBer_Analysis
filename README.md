# Pyber with Matplotlib

## Purpose
In this project we have to use our new Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then also use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that displays the total weekly fares for each city type. And lastly, we are to submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers of the company PyBer.

## Results
According to the summary dataframe, the data suggests that types of areas/ cities correlate to the total number of rides---the dataframe displays that Urban cities produce more rides (1625), whereas Rural areas produce the least amount of rides (125). The data also suggests that Urban cities have more drivers (2405) and Rural areas have the least amount of drivers (78). The data shows that heavily populated areas such as Urban cities have high counts of total rides and total drivers. 

In terms of cost, Urban cities produce more revenue for the company---which can be attributed to the high demand for ride-sharing services. However, the AVERAGE FARE PER RIDE and the AVERAGE FARE PER DRIVER is less in Urban cities ($24.53, $16.57)---compared to Rural areas ($34.62, $55.49). The data indicates that location/ area/ and high demand for ride-sharing services correlates to the average fare (per ride and per driver)---demonstrating that the highly populated areas and high demand for ride-sharing services produces fairly cheap fares and low driver fares. But the consolation prize for low driver fares in Urban cities is that there is more customers to attend to---in copmarison to Rural areas, where there are not alot of customers seeking the ride-sharing service. 

In the multiple-line chart, we were able to compare total fares by city type over the course of five months (from Jan. - May). The number of rides seem peak at the end of February and decrease by the time March comes along. Each line for each city type displays very similar trends---however the red line for Suburban areas shows a sharp increase in the month of April.

## Summary 
In terms of further business analysis for Pyber ride share service---the company should do a more in-depth research on the correlation of the sharp increase in April within Suburban areas because Urban and Rural citites display a decrease during the month of April. 

Another business suggestion for Pyber is to look further into the high average fare per ride and average fare driver in Rural areas---encouraging other Pyber drivers to work in Rural areas might increase the demand for ride-share services in Rural areas. 

Lastly, a business suggestion for Pyber is to look into the Urban Average Fare Per Driver, it is the lowest fare for drivers out of all the city types. That could suggest that the supply of drivers exceeds the demand of the service in Urban cities. These drivers could potentially be encouraged to work in Suburban or Rural areas, to gain more lucrative/ monetary opportunities.
